# Tic Tac Toe

A simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. This project allows two players to play Tic Tac Toe on a graphical interface.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay
- Graphical user interface
- Reset functionality using the "R" key
- Checks for winning conditions and displays the winner

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have Python and Pygame installed. You can install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd tic-tac-toe
   ```

3. Run the game:

   ```bash
   python tic_tac_toe.py
   ```

   (Replace `tic_tac_toe.py` with the name of your main Python file if it's different.)

## Controls

- Click on a square to place your marker (circle or cross).
- Press the "R" key to restart the game.

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns to place their markers.
- The first player to get three of their markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
